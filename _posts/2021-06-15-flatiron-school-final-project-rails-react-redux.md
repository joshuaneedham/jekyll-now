## Rails, React, Redux oh my!

With my final project for FlatIron School finally completed I'm so excited to continue moving forward, learning, and building. This is a major milestone for me as I have put off completing this final project for far too long. Taking breaks of months at a time due to life getting in the way, work that doesn't really require the skills I've learned from the bootcamp I started back in September of 2018, and any other excuse I have used for not pushing myself. The final straw was a change in the Learn.co program which placed a deadline on completion in order to graduate and I couldn't possibly let myself down and not complete this program. For me it is a life accomplishment as it is for many other. Unlike many others, my current position doesn't allow me to really apply the skills learned, so it was for personal gain only at this point. Regardless of the reasons it's important to finish what you start and for that I am very happy.

So this application builds on 3 other projects I've sompleted for the program and I've progressivily improved them with each new project requirement. I started with a Sinatra application, next up was a Rails app, then Rails with Javascript, and now Rails with React and Redux. 

I am a firearms enthusiast and I wanted to create a tool that allows others to track how many rounds they have shot through a particular firearm barrel. The reason this is important specifically for those that shoot competitively is that barrels are a consumable and require replacement after having shot a number of rounds. Keeping track of shots is commonplace and there really wasn't a tool out there that is easy to use for tracking. Most just use a notebook or spreadsheet for keeping track and I wanted a better tool, one that I could continually improve and add additional functionality.

This was by far the most difficult project mainly due to the time I took to complete, constantly updated code from community contributed packages and version changes that I continually had to deal with updating. This is inherent in the developer space as improvements are made and security vulnerabilities are dealt with.
