I decided to continue on with my Sinatra app as previously mentioned and build out a rails app using the idea as a starting point for my Rails portfolio application. Flatiron has been great and I'm looing forward to moving along on my journey to Full Stack Developer.

The Rails project consists of several advancments over the Sinatra app including `devise` with `omniauth` authentication which allows a new user to login with their Facebook account.

More to come on this project as I progress through the curriculum.
