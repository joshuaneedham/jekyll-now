Welcome to my new blog. I decided on [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) available on GitHub.

Looking forward to posting about my latest adventures that include learning Full Stack Web Development at Flat Iron School using their online platform Learn.co. I'm very impressed with the offerings and having a blast learning about Ruby currently.
